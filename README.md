i, I just started programming and I have this assignment and I want to do the advanced options but I have problems trying to do them.  This is the assignment.  Specification:  • The user of this program is an employee taking an order from a customer.  • Each time the program runs it takes a single customer’s order.  • Print a welcome message that the user can read to the customer.  • Print a menu of the items that can be ordered. By selecting something from the menu, the user is adding that item to the customer’s order.  • Each time a new item is added to the customer’s order, the current total price is printed.  • The menu is printed each time the user is ready to add a new item.  • When the customer doesn’t want to order any more items, the user enters an item that indicates the customer is done.  • A summary of the order is presented to the user, including the total price for this order. The price must be presented in dollars and cents.  • Print a “nice” message for the user to read to the customer when they are done ordering that includes the items ordered, and the total price. The program exits.   Basically, I wrote this code for the assignment:
